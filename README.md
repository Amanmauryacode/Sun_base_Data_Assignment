# Customer Management System

## Description

This project implements a Customer Management System that integrates with a set of APIs to perform various operations such as authentication, creating, updating, listing, and deleting customers. The APIs are provided by the backend service at http://localhost:8088/sunbase/portal/api/assignment.

The project is designed to have a basic UI in HTML that allows users to perform the following actions:

1. **Login**: Users can authenticate themselves using their login credentials to obtain a bearer token. This token is required for subsequent API calls.

2. **View Customer List**: After successful authentication, the user can view the list of existing customers fetched from the backend service.

3. **Create Customer**: Users can add a new customer to the system by providing mandatory details such as first name and last name.

4. **Update Customer**: Users can update the information of an existing customer by providing the unique identifier (UUID) and updated details.

5. **Delete Customer**: Users can remove a customer from the system by providing a unique identifier (UUID).
